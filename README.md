Explanation:
Employee Class: Contains properties Id, FirstName, and LastName.

Overloaded == Operator: This method checks if two Employee objects are equal by comparing their Id properties. If both objects are null, they are considered equal. If only one is null, they are not equal. If both are non-null, their Id properties are compared.

Overloaded != Operator: This is the opposite of the == operator, checking if two objects are not equal.

Override of Equals and GetHashCode: These methods are overridden to ensure that the logic of equality is consistent with the overloaded operators. Overriding GetHashCode() prevents warnings when comparing objects that overload == and !=.

Program Class: Two Employee objects, emp1 and emp2, are instantiated with different Id values, and they are compared using the overloaded == operator. Then, a third Employee object (emp3) with the same Id as emp1 is created, and emp1 is compared with emp3.
